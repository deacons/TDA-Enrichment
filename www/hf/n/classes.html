          <p>Energy can be stored in the body in the form of carbohydrates and this is particularly important for endurance performers, who may not be able to restock their energy stores adequately while they are competing. Carbohydrates are high in glucose and enter the blood. Excess glucose is stored as glycogen in the liver and muscles. Extra glucose is not wasted, but converted into glycogen or fat and stored.</p>

          <p>It contributes to the development and growth of hormones and haemoglobin in the blood, both of which are essential for those involved in sport or regular physical activity. Protein is necessary for the growth and repair of body tissues. It is also a relatively minor source of energy (10%).</p>

      <div class="content-block">
        <div class="content-block-inner">
          <p>There are many forms of fat in the body and it supplies around 70% of our energy requirements. Fat supplies energy (calories) that can either be used immediately or stored for future use. Although fat is the body’s preferred energy source, it also uses energy in the form of stored carbohydrate (glycogen) for intensive burst of energy. If we consume an excessive amount of fat, it is stored in the body tissues and causes us to become overweight. In order to avoid this, dieticians recommend that we should not consume more than ⅓rd of our daily nutritional needs in the form of fat.</p>

      <div class="content-block-title">Fibre</div>
      <div class="content-block">
        <div class="content-block-inner">
          <p>Dietary fibre comprises the edible parts of plants that are not broken down and absorbed in the small intestine. It does not contain any nutrients. It therefore adds bulk to our food without adding extra kilojoules. Fibre regulates the digestive system.</p>

      <div class="content-block">
        <div class="content-block-inner">
          <p>Minerals are required by the body for a variety of functions including the formation of bones & teeth, as essential constituents of body fluids & tissues, components of enzyme systems, and nerve function.</p>

        <div class="content-block-inner">
          <p>Vitamins are chemical compounds found in the food we eat. Our bodies cannot make vitamins so must take them from our food. Vitamins perform the following functions: aiding growth, increasing resistance to infection, regulating some body functions such as good vision, and helping the metabolism of certain foods.</p>

      <div class="content-block-title">Water</div>
      <div class="content-block">
        <div class="content-block-inner">
          <p>Water makes up 70% of the human body. It is essential for the correct functioning of virtually all living cells. Water has many functions: it provides the medium in which most reactions in the body occur, it acts as a lubricant for joints and eyes, and it helps regulate body temperature. The amount of water we drink varies from person to person, depending on age, time of year, climatic conditions, diet, the amount of physical activity we do. Dehydration is common amongst athletes, especially in hot climates, or at altitude. As little as a 2% loss of bodyweight can result in impaired responses and performance. Water replacement is essential before, during and after exercise.</p>
