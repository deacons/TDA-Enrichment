          <p>There's SO much information on nutrition that I could fill this app with it! Here's what I'll do:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Cover the basics here, and</li>
            <li>Provide the links for you to do some research for yourself.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>What YOU eat will literally shape your future. It won't be someone else putting food into your mouth. You won't be force fed food you don't want. It will be YOU eating, YOU making choices about what you eat, when you eat, how much you eat. What you eat is what you are. End of story. No myths, no fads, just YOUR choices.</p>

          <p>The basics…</p>
          <p>If you want to get the balance of your diet right, use the eatwell plate. The eatwell plate makes healthy eating easier to understand by showing the types and proportions of foods we need to have a healthy and well balanced diet. The eatwell plate shows how much of what you eat should come from each food group. This includes everything you eat during the day, including snacks.</p>
          <p>So, try to eat:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Plenty of fruit and vegetables</li>
            <li>Plenty of bread, rice, potatoes, pasta and other starchy foods – choose wholegrain varieties whenever you can</li>
            <li>Some milk and dairy foods</li>
            <li>Some meat, fish, eggs, beans and other non-dairy sources of protein</li>
            <li>Just a small amount of foods and drinks high in fat and/or sugar</li>
            <li>Look at the eatwell plate to see how much of your food should come from each food group. You don’t need to get the balance right at every meal. But try to get it right over time such as a whole day or week.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Try to choose options that are lower in fat, salt and sugar when you can.</p>
          <p>The eatwell plate is consistent with the Government’s Eight tips for eating well, published in October 2005, which are:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Base your meals on starchy foods</li>
            <li>Eat lots of fruit and veg</li>
            <li>Eat more fish</li>
            <li>Cut down on saturated fat and sugar</li>
            <li>Try to eat less salt – no more than 6g a day</li>
            <li>Get active and try to be a healthy weight</li>
            <li>Drink plenty of water</li>
            <li>Don’t skip breakfast</li>
          </ol>
