        <p>Whether you're brand new to this whole exercise experience, or fitness is old hat, you probably still know what resistance training entails, or know it by one of its many other names: strength training, weight training, pumping iron, anaerobic exercise, etc.</p>
        <p>This is the chapter you've either been waiting for or dreading. If you're a male and breathing, you may start to get a bit fired up by now. If you're a female, and fairly new to fitness, you might have doubts, or even visions of morphing into a 300-pound monster with arms like ham hocks as soon as you start bench pressing. Relax, its not like that.</p>

          <p>Resistance training is not just about building muscle that will help you look great. Its also a prehab for preventing injuries and making sure you feel great. Resistance training also turns back the clock by reversing many factors that naturally occur in the ageing process.</p>
          <p>Reshaping your muscles can even help you stay leaner. Aerobic exercise burns more calories per minute and gets your metabolism into overdrive faster than resistance training. However, after you've finished weight training, your body has to use extra calories throughout the day just to sustain the new, leaner body you've built for yourself. Using weights effectively will keep your metabolism turned on all day long.</p>
          <p>So think of muscle as a fat burning friend who's with you all day long. The more muscle you have, the higher your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). What's a BMR, and why should you care about it? Your BMR is another important number: it is the number of calories you burn every day to keep your body functioning, your heart beating, your lungs breathing, and so on. It's your BMR that accounts for almost 75% of all of the calories you burn daily, with the other 25% being burned from all your daily physical activities.</p>
          <p>Building more muscle though resistance training means you'll have extra muscle fibres consuming more energy. Even when you're just sitting there looking good but not doing a thing. In fact, every pound of muscle you add to your frame burns an additional 30 to 50 calories per day. Substitute 5 pounds of muscle for 5 pounds of fat and not only will you naturally be more aesthetically in shape, but you'll burn and extra 150-250 calories a day doing absolutely nothing at all.</p>

          <p>You already know that Aerobic activity is any activity that increases your pulse for an extended period of time, causing your heart and lungs to work harder to get more oxygen to your muscles. Resistance training, Anaerobic exercise is any activity done in short, intense bursts that works your body without requiring much oxygen.</p>
          <p>Resistance training means working one muscle (or a group of muscles) against some form of resistance so that your muscles have no choice but to break down from fatigue and stress. Do it the right way, and those beaten-down muscles have no choice but to rebuild themselves so they're stronger for the next time you decide to put them through the paces.</p>
          <p>No matter what tool you use to stress your muscles  barbells, dumbbells, weight machines, stretch cords, medicine balls, your own body weight  if you provide enough resistance to fatigue your muscles by making them repeat a movement for a given number of repetitions, you'll achieve the same goal.</p>
          <p>Heres how it works: Lifting the weight one time is called a repetition (rep). A group of repetitions performed without stopping is called a set. The number of reps you should do to fatigue your muscles depends on your goals. Most experts stick with using a weight you can lift, raise, or pull 8 to 15 times. If you're looking to noticeably strengthen your muscles, then using a heavier weight that allows you do to between 6 and 10 reps is better. If improving muscle tone is your goal then 10 to 15 reps is more suited and lastly muscle endurance 15 to 20 reps.</p>

          <p>The choices you have with resistance training are virtually limitless  there are literally hundreds of exercises that will prevent your muscles (or you) from being bored.</p>
          <p>The best resistance training workout leaves no stone unturned. It's a program that targets every major muscle group in your body, not just the ones you're concerned with. These 13 exercises are for overall muscle-development. There are countless spin-off movements from these core exercises. Learn these, master them effectively, and then variations can be added.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>For your legs and butt → The squat and the lunge</li>
            <li>For your chest → The chest press and the chest fly</li>
            <li>For your back → The pulldown and the row</li>
            <li>For your shoulders → The shoulder press and the raise</li>
            <li>For your triceps → The pressdown and the extension</li>
            <li>For your biceps → The curl</li>
            <li>For your abs → The crunch and the reverse crunch</li>
          </ul>

          <p>If resistance training has never worked for you and you use perfect form (perfect technique during an exercise), Id say that you're using weights that are too light for you. If you're not using a weight heavy enough to fully fatigue during each set, you'll never push them enough to make them want, and need, to improve themselves. For example, if an exercise asks you do 12-15 repetitions, you need to select a weight that you can complete only 12-15 reps with while keeping good form. If you could have easily eked out three more reps before quitting, your muscles were never really challenged enough to improve themselves, making the entire set less effective than it should and certainly could have been. Once you can do more than the required number of reps, then its time to raise the weight slightly.</p>

                <p>If you're a guy, you can probably skip over this question! If you're a woman  You wont get big! As a rule, thats because most women are simply not genetically capable of ballooning up from strength training alone. Your body has 10% of the testosterone that the average male has  and look at how hard it is for a man to add muscle. Even they cant do it without lifting heavy weights, eating steak for breakfast, milkshakes all day, and doing sets of 4 to 6 reps! I think you get my point!</p>
                <p>If you're worried about adding a pound of muscle, it's estimated that the space of a pound of muscle is about 22% less than a pound of fat. That means adding 5 pounds of muscle and losing 5 pounds of fat would actually make you look smaller. I'd say thats a fair trade off. Finally, muscle isn't created by weights. It's created by food  proteins to be more precise. You have to eat quality and a quantity of food above and beyond what you burn, and break the muscle down in the gym so they need to repair, plus eat every 3 to 4 hours, and get adequate rest so that they recover... Do you see what I mean? Besides, it's not an overnight process, so you could always back off or even stop.</p>

                <p>Welcome to the biggest con in fitness and exercise. It may be the quick fix you're wishing for, but spot reduction (the popular term for it) is one of the biggest exercise lies out there. It's impossible to lose weight in one particular area by lifting weights or doing exercises that target only that area. You body burns fat in a genetically predetermined patter over which you have no control. But there's good news: As you start driving on all four wheels, you'll begin to burn fat gradually from all over your body, including your specific wish list of areas. Typically the last place you store fat is the first area you'll see a noticeable difference. Unfortunately, that also means the first place you started storing fat is usually the last area to get lean: men around the waist; women around the hips/butt.</p>
                <p>Until you reduce the body fat above or around your muscles through cardiovascular exercise, resistance training, eating right, and adequate rest you'll never make those muscles or perfect set of abs visible.</p>
