        <p>It sounds like the easiest wheel of the five to drive on, but it's actually the one that most frequently gets either too much or too little use. Give your body too much rest and it'll look like it. Give it too little and you increase your odds of not only injuring yourself, but never seeing the body-shaping results you're shooting for.</p>

          <p>Whether you hate or love exercise, your body interprets all that time you've spent pulling, pushing, and sweating on gym equipment as on thing: stress. Thats why the time you give your muscles to rest and recover in between each workout can make a huge difference in the kind of results you end up seeing for all of your hard work.</p>
          <p>Rest is also important between sets at the gym, 30 to 180 seconds ideally, depending on the intensity of the exercise and the routine. This downtime gives your body time to drain the muscles of any leftover lactic acid (a by-product of exercise that gives that fun, burning sensation towards the end of a set!).</p>
          <p>Resting between workouts or lack of it is one of the biggest mistakes most overzealous exercisers make. Lifting weight causes microscopic breaks or tears inside your muscle fibres, breaks that trick your body into thinking its about go to war. These fibres react by rebuilding their legions to be stronger and firmer for the next battle, that is, if you give them an armistice to start recruiting. After exhausting a muscle with resistance training, it needs at least 48-72 hours of recovery time in order to heal from all that microscopic damage. If you work out before that time you risk injury, you wont be able to lift as much weight which will hold you back from using enough resistance to make your muscles stronger. Muscle strength is directly relative to muscle size. Increase your strength and the muscles have to respond by increasing in volume.</p>
          <p>A decent nights sleep. Most healthy adults need an average of 7 to 9 hours of sleep a night. Whatever your cycle is, find it, stick with it.</p>
