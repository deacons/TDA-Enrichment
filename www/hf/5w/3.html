        <p>Eating right isn't really all that complicated. It's a choice, and a conscious, daily choice at that. Making the right choice on a regular basis, and sticking with your choice over time, will get you there.</p>

          <p>Choose to eat the right way and you won't just improve every possible aspect of your health, but you'll make the job of reshaping yourself through exercising that much easier. The time-starved amongst us are at the mercy of convenience eating. You are your own food-police deciding the type of foods you eat; I can't monitor that all the time because I'm only with you for 1 hour at the gym. The other 23 hours are your responsibility.</p>
          <p>Ingest the wrong foods and you can easily prevent your system from operating at its most efficient level especially if you're active. Eat less than enough to counterbalance the extra nutritional requirements your body needs to maintain itself and you'll store the same excess fat you're trying to get rid of because your body thinks it's going to starve, and so it hold onto every calorie in anticipation of not getting any more.</p>
          <p>Regardless of what your goals are from exercise, following a few basic nutrition rules of the thumb will make this 3<sup>rd</sup> wheel worth a lot more to your body than you ever thought it could be.</p>

          <p>If you're trying to lose weight, calories may represent a guilty pleasure or a great evil to your brain. But to your body, calories are just energy units to be used as fuel.</p>
          <p>You wouldn't give your car more fuel than it really needed, would you? If you did, all the fuel would just overflow and make a mess, right? That's exactly what happens with your body: when you eat more calories than it needs, the result is overflow to every place your body holds excess calories (i.e. fat). It doesn't know you don't want to gain weight, it just sees all those extra calories and assumes you want to store them as energy for later on.</p>
          <p>Stand up and jump an inch or two off the ground. Anything move? For every pound of stored body fat you felt jiggle, all you're really looking at is roughly 3500 calories. Just 3500 units of fuel your body thinks it needs to hold onto because you haven't given it any reason to think otherwise. But don't worry. Now that you know why you're storing calories, it's going to be easier to convince your body to use them up and stop storing then unnecessarily.</p>
          <p>Eating a low-fat, high-fibre diet along with doing aerobic exercise to burn calories (and resistance training to maintain lean mass and to naturally boost your metabolism) is the most effective way to lose fat without holding you back from building muscle tissue. Try not to use the word diet because it makes people feel like they're walking a tightrope: one tiny misstep (doughnut!) and they assume that all their hopes and dreams will come crashing down. Diets are usually temporary by nature, leading to eventual failure, whereas an on-going healthy nutritional intake that is a lifestyle will last a lifetime.</p>

      <div class="content-block">
        <div class="content-block-inner">
          <p>How many calories you really need to eat every day depends on who you are. Some people can maintain their bodyweight on 1400 calories a day, whereas others have metabolisms like a hummingbird: eat suet at every meal and never put on an ounce of fat. It all depends on everything from your metabolism and level of activity to your age, heritage, gender,  what you're putting in your mouth, and when you're putting it in your mouth.</p>
          <p>As a starting point the most common method used by dieticians and other health-care professionals is the Harris-Benedict formula.</p>
          <p>Men: 66 + (6.3 x wt in lbs) + (12.9 x height in inches) - (6.8 x age in years)</p>
          <p>Women: 655 + (4.3 x wt in lbs) + (4.7 x height in inches) - (4.7 x age in years)</p>
          <p>The number you are left with is your estimated basal metabolic rate expenditure (or BMR): the minimum number of calories your body needs just to keep you going. Getting to school, typing up that report, racing around trying to find a decent place to eat  these are all extra actions that increase your BMR by around 20%. For example a 35 year old woman who weighs 140lbs and stands 5 feet 6 inches would have a BMR of approx. 1402 calories a day. Multiply this by 120% and all she really needs to eat every day is 1683 calories. If your goal is to trim down, its just a matter of eating less and/or burning extra calories through exercise to lose weight.</p>

      <div class="content-block-title">Carbohydrates, Proteins and Fats</div>
      <div class="content-block">
        <div class="content-block-inner">
          <p>No matter how many calories you need each day, its important to make sure they don't all come from the same place. Carbohydrates, proteins, and fats are all broken down at different speeds in the body to create a continual flow of caloric energy.</p>
          <p>Most nutritionists recommend dividing up your daily Carbohydrates, proteins, and fats using a ratio of 5:3:2 (respectively). This translates into getting 50% of your daily calories from carbs, 30% from protein, and 20% from fat. Using the example above, the woman that requires 1683 calories to maintain her weight would have a nutritional profile as follows to maintain her weight:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Carbohydrate	841.5 cal. (50%)</li>
            <li>Protein			504.9 cal. (30%)</li>
            <li>Fat				336.6 cal. (20%)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>To make this number crunching easier to calculate for everyday living we can equate these numbers further into grams and workout how much to allow for each meal.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Carbohydrate	210g (4 cal/g)</li>
            <li>Protein			126g (4 cal/g)</li>
            <li>Fat				37g (9 cal/g)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Its healthier to eat all day long, breaking-up your caloric intake into smaller increments (5 to 6 meals) instead of the standard 3, you also help curb binges, and also keep blood sugar levels even throughout the day. Larger meals raise your blood sugar, which can trigger an increase in the release of insulin within the bloodstream. Remember, little and often. The easiest way to accomplish 5 or even 6 meals per day is to moderate the traditional 3 meals in size and snack in between. One snack mid-morning and one mid-afternoon.</p>
          <p>For the example above based on 1683 calories, each of the 5 meals would average 336 calories, carbs 42 grams, protein 25 grams, fats 7 grams. It would be unrealistic to expect an exact equality between meals but use these figures as a guide.</p>
          <p>There is so much good information on nutrition: what's good, what's not, nutrition plans, when to eat, when to stop, etc. I'll leave that for you to decide whats a wise choice and what's an unwise choice (cue another 30 minutes cycling!).</p>
          <p>These are my nutritional guidelines:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Most caloric meal - breakfast; the least - dinner. Drink 4-pints of water a day. Chicken, tuna (packed in water), eggs, wholemeal bread and rice. Plenty of fruit and veg. Protein shakes are convenient as are smoothies for snacks.</li>
            <li>Read all labels, avoid sugar and salt. After 4pm drop pasta, rice, potato and bread. Obtain carbs from veg and salads for evening meal.</li>
            <li>Protein sources  Lean mince beef, chicken, fish, soya, eggs</li>
            <li>Carbs  Wholemeal bread and rice, porridge. Plenty of fruit (such as apples, bananas, oranges, satsumas, grapes, pears, strawberries, peaches, apricots) and vegetables (carrots, broccoli, spinach, beans)</li>
            <li>Healthy fats: vegetable oils, oily fish, nuts, omega 3 enriched eggs, olive oil olives, seeds.</li>
          </ul>
