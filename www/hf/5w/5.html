          <p>What makes one person lie on a sofa eating pizza, chips and cake, while another may be up at 6am pounding the streets trying to beat a personal best? Why are some people more motivated than others? Not just at sport, exercise or at work, but in life?</p>
          <p>Each of us has motivations, goals and inspirational figures that shape what we do, what we think, how we react. Some of these goals are verbalised, debated and shared, some are deep rooted and personal. It all starts in the mind.</p>
          <p>Life is a mind game. All your aspirations are played out in your head. All your relationships are shaped in your head. Your mind dictates whether you fulfil your potential or live your life dreaming.  It's about attitude. The good thing in life is that you can choose your attitude, you cant always choose or change the circumstances in your arena, but you can always choose or change your attitude.</p>
          <p>Sport and exercise provide a framework for personal development. It appeals to people because it meets a basic, instinctive need to want to take on challenges and succeed, and encourages people to develop skills along the way.</p>
          <p>It's inappropriate to talk about a healthy lifestyle, fitness regime or weight training program as a sacrifice. What top performers do is make choices. We all have choices to make, its all about attitude.</p>
          <p>If you want to lose weight or gain some definition in your arms you can visualise how you want to look after you've succeeded. So many people on diets (temporary punishment!) don't actually see themselves how they want to be, getting into certain clothes. If you visualise the result in advance it'll help on days when you lose your motivation. But what is visualisation? It's the process of seeing yourself doing what it is you need to do  whether running a winning race, throwing a record breaking javelin distance or lifting your heaviest weight. What the mind imagines usually creates a capacity for the body to do it.</p>
          <p>What a person believes can determine the outcome. There is no doubt that in sport as in many other areas of life, there is such a thing as the self-fulfilling prophecy. If you limit your beliefs, you limit your potential to achieve.</p>
