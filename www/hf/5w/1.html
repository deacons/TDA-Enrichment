        <p>This is the wheel that those desperate to lose weight fast always drive on first. Even though it's not the answer to helping you obtain that celebrity-perfect look by itself, aerobic exercise is still a valuable wheel.</p>

        <div class="content-block-inner">
          <p>Without aerobic training, you'll lack the adequate stamina to push your muscles beyond what they're capable of doing so they will become stronger and shape up faster. Without aerobic training you'll have to watch calories religiously, your body wont be as efficient at flushing out the toxins that resistance training leaves behind, such as lactic acid. Add the fact that aerobic training improves the quality of your sleep and its pretty easy to see how it fits into the bigger picture.</p>

          <p>The term aerobic means with oxygen. Aerobic activity is any physical activity done for an extended period of time that forces your cardiovascular system (heart, lungs and blood vessels) to increase the amount of oxygen and blood circulating through your body, so that you're benefiting even at rest. Your body doesn't care how you make that happen, although choosing activities that work larger muscle groups, typically your legs, is more effective at getting that job done.</p>
          <p>To count as aerobic exercise, any activity you choose has to keep your heart beating around sixty-five percent of your maximum heart rate for at least 20 minutes or more.</p>
          <p>Your maximum heart rate, or MHR, is the highest number of times your heart can contract in one minute. To find yours, all you do is subtract your age from the number 220. That means if you're 35 years old, your MHR is 220 minus 35 (or 185 beats per minute). This is an important number to know, as it can help you know how hard you should be exercising.</p>
          <p>To get the most from aerobic exercise, you need to keep your pulse between a range of 60% and 70% of your MHR to burn fat. For the 35 year old that equates to a pulse of between 111 to 130 per minute. If you increase the intensity you're working at to between 70% and 80% this will improve your aerobic fitness, the pulse rate will then be at 130 to 148 beats per minute.</p>
          <p>Try to do some form of aerobic activity 3 times a week, for at least 20 minutes. More is better; less might be suitable if you have a favourable metabolism. If you can do more than 20 minutes, then do it: every minute past the twenty burns additional body fat as fuel. After that magic number (20 minutes), you've exhausted your body's glycogen (carbohydrate) stores, which it uses as fuel when you workout. From a fat-burning standpoint, if you can exercise beyond 20 minutes, your body has no choice but to use more of its own stored body fat for energy instead.</p>

          <p>There are hundreds of things you could do to get an aerobic workout besides using the typical gym machines (stationary bikes, treadmills, cross-trainers and rowing machines) and the obvious outside choices (biking, jogging, running, swimming and walking). If you're not into any of these don't write off exercise, as playing a sport, dancing, ice-skating skiing, kayaking, rollerblading, even house cleaning and gardening can be aerobic if done a certain way at a certain intensity!</p>

        <div class="content-block-inner">
          <p>If you want a workout your body will never get used to (or forgive you for), try flip-flopping between your cardio choices at the gym (stationary bike, treadmill, step routine, jump rope, stair climber or rower) every three minutes. Make the first minute a warm-up, push yourself around 65% of your MHR for the second minute (or on a scale 1 to 10 in effort, around a 6), then go for it in the last minute (85% or level 8 effort).</p>

      <div class="content-block">
        <div class="content-block-inner">
          <p>Pushing yourself higher within your target heart rate zone will definitely reap more results, but you need to know when too much is too much. If you can't speak a full sentence while exercising without being winded, then you're most likely pushing yourself to the far end of your target heart rate zone. On the other hand, if you're able to carry on a full conversation, then you're probably working at a level thats below your target heart rate zone.</p>
