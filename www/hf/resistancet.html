          <p>Resistance training is not just about building muscle that will help you look great. Its also a prehab for preventing injuries and making sure you feel great. Resistance training also turns back the clock by reversing many factors that naturally occur in the ageing process.</p>
          <p>Reshaping your muscles can even help you stay leaner. Aerobic exercise burns more calories per minute and gets your metabolism into overdrive faster than resistance training. However, after you've finished weight training, your body has to use extra calories throughout the day just to sustain the new, leaner body you've built for yourself. Using weights effectively will keep your metabolism going all day long.</p>
          <h4>The Facts</h4>
          <p>Resistance training means working one muscle (or a group of muscles) against some form of resistance so that your muscles have no choice but to break down from fatigue and stress. Do it the right way, and those beaten-down muscles have no choice but to rebuild themselves so they're stronger for the next time you decide to put them through the paces.</p>
          <p>No matter what tool you use to stress your muscles  barbells, dumbbells, weight machines, stretch cords, medicine balls, your own body weight  if you provide enough resistance to fatigue your muscles by making them repeat a movement for a given number of repetitions, you'll achieve the same goal.</p>
          <p>Heres how it works: Lifting the weight one time is called a repetition (rep). A group of repetitions performed without stopping is called a set.</p>
          <p>The number of reps you should do to fatigue your muscles depends on your goals. Most experts stick with using a weight you can lift, raise, or pull 8 to 15 times.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>For Strength - 6 to 10 reps</li>
            <li>For Toning - 10 to 15 reps</li>
            <li>For Endurance - 15 to 20 reps</li>
          </ul>
          <p>â€¦but remember, whatever amount of reps you are doing the weight needs to be heavy enough to make your muscles work. There is no point in doing a weight that's too easy, as your muscles won't be overloaded and forced to react or grow.</p>
