        <p>Training for years 7 &amp; 8 should be based around aerobic activity, however there are some exercises that can be undertaken using bodyweight as resistance.</p>
        <p>As a minimum you should be doing at least 30 minutes of Aerobic activity as a starter (bike, row, run, cross-train, power walk!). Try doing between 5 and 10 minutes on each, which makes the time go faster. You should get into the habit of recording what you do in those 5-10 minutes: how far you went, what the resistance was set on, how many calories you burned, etc. It'll give you a target each time you do your workout.</p>
