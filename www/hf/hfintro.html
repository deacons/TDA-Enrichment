          <p>Welcome to the TDA Health &amp; Fitness mini-site. Here you will find information on the main aspects of Health and Fitness along with other resources. If you can't find what you want on here, or require further information, please e-mail Mr Hoffmann with suggestions or ideas.</p>
          <p>Before you start on <i>any</i> fitness training program, remember: if you have any injuries, medical conditions or are not sure about what to do, ask a member of staff or check with your doctor that it's fine for you to train.</p>
          <p>Warm-ups. You <i>have</i> to do them, read the Warm-Up page first and include one with every workout, run, row, team game, individual event. Make it a habit and it will go along way to help you stay injury-free.</p>
