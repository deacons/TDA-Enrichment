                <p>Muscle stiffness is thought to be directly related to muscle injury and therefore the warm up should be aimed at reducing muscle stiffness.</p>
                <h4>Warming up should at least consist of the following:</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>5 to 10 minutes jogging to increase body temperature</li>
                  <li>10 to 15 minutes dynamic stretching exercises to reduce muscle stiffness</li>
                  <li>10 to 15 minutes general and event specific drills to prepare for the session or competition: e.g. for a runner:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Lower leg drills</li>
                      <li>Leg drills</li>
                      <li>Technique drills</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>4 to 8 easy run outs over 30 to 60 metres - focus on correct running technique (Tall, Relaxed, Smooth and Drive)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Dynamic stretches are more appropriate to the warm up as they help reduce muscle stiffness. Static stretching exercises do not reduce muscle stiffness.</p>
                <h4>What are the benefits of a warm up?</h4>
                <p>Performance may be improved, as an appropriate warm up will result in an:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Increased speed of contraction and relaxation of warmed muscles</li>
                  <li>Dynamic exercises reduce muscle stiffness</li>
                  <li>Greater economy of movement because of lowered viscous resistance within warmed muscles</li>
                  <li>Facilitated oxygen utilisation by warmed muscles because haemoglobin releases oxygen more readily at higher muscle temperatures</li>
                  <li>Facilitated nerve transmission and muscle metabolism at higher temperatures; a specific warm up can facilitate motor unit recruitment required in subsequent all out activity</li>
                  <li>Increased blood flow through active tissues as local vascular beds dilate, increasing metabolism and muscle temperatures</li>
                  <li>Allows the heart rate get to a workable rate for beginning exercise</li>
                  <li>Mentally focused on the training or competition</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Cooling down should consist of the following:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>5 to 10 minutes jogging/walking - decrease body temperature and remove waste products from the working muscles</li>
                  <li>5 to 10 minutes static stretching exercises</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Static stretches are more appropriate to the cool down as they help muscles to relax, realign muscle fibres and re-establish their normal range of movement. These stretches should be held for approximately 10 seconds.</p>
                <h4>What are the benefits of a cool down?</h4>
                <p>An appropriate cool down will:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>aid in the dissipation of waste products, including lactic acid</li>
                  <li>reduce the potential for DOMS</li>
                  <li>reduce the chances of dizziness or fainting caused by the pooling of venous blood at the extremities</li>
                  <li>reduce the level of adrenaline in the blood</li>
                  <li>allows the heart rate to return to its resting rate</li>
