				<h3>The First Wheel: Aerobic Training</h3>
				<p>This is the wheel that those desperate to lose weight fast always drive on first. Even though its not the answer to helping you obtain that celebrity-perfect look by itself, aerobic exercise is still a valuable wheel.</p>
				<h4>The Facts</h4>
				<p>Without aerobic training, youll lack the adequate stamina to push your muscles beyond what theyre capable of doing so they will become stronger and shape up faster. Without aerobic training youll have to watch calories religiously, your body wont be as efficient at flushing out the toxins that resistance training leaves behind, such as lactic acid. Add the fact that aerobic training improves the quality of your sleep and its pretty easy to see how it fits into the bigger picture.</p>
				<h4>Foundation</h4>
				<p>The term aerobic means with oxygen. Aerobic activity is any physical activity done for an extended period of time that forces your cardiovascular system (heart, lungs and blood vessels) to increase the amount of oxygen and blood circulating through your body, so that youre benefiting even at rest. Your body doesnt care how you make that happen, although choosing activities that work larger muscle groups, typically your legs, is more effective at getting that job done.</p>
				<p>To count as aerobic exercise, any activity you choose has to keep your heart beating around sixty-five percent of your maximum heart rate for at least 20 minutes or more.</p>
				<p>Your maximum heart rate, or MHR, is the highest number of times your heart can contract in one minute. To find yours, all you do is subtract your age from the number 220. That means if youre 35 years old, you MHR is 220 minus 35 (or 185 beats per minute). This is an important number to know, as it can help you know how hard you should be exercising.</p>
				<p>To get the most from aerobic exercise, you need to keep your pulse between a range of 60% and 70% of your MHR to burn fat. For the 35 year old that equates to a pulse of between 111 to 130 per minute. If you increase the intensity youre working at to between 70% and 80% this will improve your aerobic fitness, the pulse rate will then be at 130 to 148 beats per minute.</p>
				<p>Try to do some form of aerobic activity 3 times a week, at least 20 minutes. More is better; less might be suitable if you have a favourable metabolism. If you can do more than 20 minutes, then do it, every minute past the twenty burns additional body fat as fuel. After that magic number (20 Minutes), youve exhausted your bodys glycogen (carbohydrate) stores, which it uses as fuel when you workout. From a fat-burning standpoint, if you can exercise beyond 20 Minutes, your body has no choice but to use more of its own stored body fat for energy instead.</p>
				<h4>Your Options</h4>
				There are hundreds of things you could do to get an aerobic workout besides using the typical gym machines (stationary bikes, tread-mills, cross-trainers and rowing machines) and the obvious outside choices (biking, jogging, running, swimming and walking). If youre not into any of these dont write off exercise, as playing a sport, dancing, ice-skating skiing, kayaking, rollerblading, even house cleaning and gardening can be aerobic if done a certain way at a certain intensity!
				<h4>Use Everything in One Workout</h4>
				<p>If you want a workout your body will never get used to (or forgive you for), try flip-flopping between your cardio choices at the gym (stationary bike, treadmill, step routine, jump rope, stair climber or rower) every three minutes. Make the first minute a warm-up, push yourself around 65% of your MHR for the second minute (or on a scale 1 to 10 in effort, around a 6), then go for it in the last minute (85% or level 8 effort).</p>
				<h4>Know When Too Much Is Too Much</h4>
				<p>Pushing yourself higher within your target heart rate zone will definitely reap more results, but you need to know when too much is too much. If you cant speak a full sentence while exercising without being winded, like Call 999, please, youre most likely pushing yourself to the far end of your target heart rate zone. On the other hand, if youre able to carry on a full conversation, then youre probably working at a level thats below your target heart rate zone.</p>
			</div>
			<div data-role="collapsible">
				<h3>The Second Wheel: Resistance Training</h3>
				<p>Whether youre brand new to this whole exercise experience or fitness is old hat, you probably still know what resistance training entails, or know it by one of its many other names: strength training, weight training, pumping iron, anaerobic exercise.</p>
				<p>This is the chapter youve either been waiting for or dreading. If youre male and breathing, you may start to get a bit fired up by now. If youre female, and fairly new to fitness, you might have doubts, or even visions of morphing into a 300-pound monster with arms like ham hocks as soon as you start bench pressing. Relax, its not like that.</p>
				<h4>The Facts</h4>
				<p>Resistance training is not just about building muscle that will help you look great. Its also a pre-hab for preventing injuries and making sure you feel great. Resistance training also turns back the clock by reversing many factors that naturally occur in the aging process.</p>
				<p>Reshaping your muscles can even help you stay leaner. Aerobic exercise burns more calories per minute and gets your metabolism into overdrive faster than resistance training. However, after youve finished weight training, your body has to use extra calories throughout the day just to sustain the new, leaner body youve built for yourself. Using weights effectively will keep your metabolism turned on all day long.</p>
				<p>So think of muscle as a fat burning friend whos with you all day long. The more muscle you have, the higher your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). Whats a BMR, and why should you care about it? Your BMR is another important number: it is the number of calories you burn every day to keep your body functioning, your heart beating, your lungs breathing, and so on. Its your BMR that accounts for almost 75% of all of the calories you burn daily, with the other 25% being burned from all your daily physical activities.</p>
				<p>Building more muscle though resistance training means youll have extra muscle fibres consuming more energy. Even when youre just sitting there looking good but not doing a thing. In fact, every pound of muscle you add to your frame burns an additional 30 to 50 calories per day. Substitute 5 pounds of muscle for 5 pounds of fat and not only will you naturally be more aesthetically in shape, but youll burn and extra 150-250 calories a day doing absolutely nothing at all.</p>
				<h4>Foundation</h4>
				<p>You already know that Aerobic activity is any activity that increases your pulse for an extended period of time, causing your heart and lungs to work harder to get more oxygen to your muscles. Resistance training, Anaerobic exercise is any activity done in short, intense bursts that works your body without requiring much oxygen.</p>
				<p>Resistance training means working one muscle (or a group of muscles) against some form of resistance so that your muscles have no choice but to break down from fatigue and stress. Do it the right way, and those beaten-down muscles have no choice but to rebuild themselves so theyre stronger for the next time you decide to put them through the paces.</p>
				<p>No matter what tool you use to stress your muscles  barbells, dumbbells, weight machines, stretch cords, medicine balls, your own body weight  if you provide enough resistance to fatigue your muscles by making them repeat a movement for a given number of repetitions, youll achieve the same goal.</p>
				<p>Heres how it works: Lifting the weight one time is called a repetition (rep). A group of repetitions performed without stopping is called a set. The number of reps you should do to fatigue your muscles depends on your goals. Most experts stick with using a weight you can lift, raise, or pull 8 to 15 times. If youre looking to noticeably strengthen your muscles, then using a heavier weight that allows you do to between 6 and 10 reps is better. If improving muscle tone is your goal then 10 to 15 reps is more suited and lastly muscle endurance 15 to 20 reps.</p>
				<h4>Your Options</h4>
				<p>The choices you have with resistance training are virtually limitless  there are literally hundreds of exercises that will prevent your muscles (or you) from being bored.</p>
				<p>The best resistance training workout leaves no stone unturned. Its a program that targets every major muscle group in your body, not just the ones youre concerned with. These 13 exercises are for overall muscle-development. There are countless spin-off movements from these core exercises. Learn these, master them effectively, and then variations can be added.</p>
				<ul>
				    <li>For your legs and butt → The squat and the lunge</li>
				    <li>For your chest → The chest press and the chest fly</li>
				    <li>For your back → The pulldown and the row</li>
				    <li>For your shoulders → The shoulder press and the raise</li>
				    <li>For your triceps → The pressdown and the extension</li>
				    <li>For your biceps → The curl</li>
				    <li>For your abs → The crunch and the reverse crunch</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Focus</h4>
				<p>If resistance training has never worked for you and you use perfect form (perfect technique during an exercise), Id say that youre using weights that are too light for you. If youre not using a weight heavy enough to fully fatigue during each set, youll never push them enough to make them want, and need, to improve themselves. For example, if an exercise asks you do 12-15 repetitions, you need to select a weight that you can complete only 12-15 reps with while keeping good form. If you could have easily eked out three more reps before quitting, your muscles were never really challenged enough to improve themselves, making the entire set less effective than it should and certainly could have been. Once you can do more than the required number of reps, then its time to raise the weight slightly.</p>
				<h4>Frequently asked questions</h4>
				<h5>Wont weights make me big?</h5>
				<p>If youre a guy, you can probably skip over this question! If youre a woman  You wont get big! As a rule, thats because most women are simply not genetically capable of ballooning up from strength training alone. Your body has 10% of the testosterone that the average male has  and look at how hard it is for a man to add muscle. Even they cant do it without lifting heavy weights, eating steak for breakfast, milkshakes all day, and doing sets of 4 to 6 reps! I think you get my point!</p>
				<p>If youre worried about adding a pound of muscle, its estimated that the space of a pound of muscle is about 22% less than a pound of fat. That means adding 5 pounds of muscle and losing 5 pounds of fat would actually make you look smaller. Id say thats a fair trade off. Finally, muscle isnt created by weights. Its created by food  proteins to be more precise. You have to eat quality and a quantity of food above and beyond what you burn, plus break the muscle down in the gym so they need to repair, plus eat every 3 to 4 hours, plus get adequate rest so that they recover, plus.do you see what I mean? Besides, its not an overnight process, so you could always back off or even stop.</p>
				<h5>Can I burn fat from a specific area by doing specific exercise?</h5>
				<p>Welcome to the biggest con in fitness and exercise. It may be the quick fix youre wishing for, but spot reduction (the popular term for it) is one of the biggest exercise lies out there. Its impossible to lose weight in one particular area by lifting weights or doing exercises that target only that area. You body burns fat in a genetically predetermined patter over which you have no control. But theres good news: As you start driving on all four wheels, youll begin to burn fat gradually from all over your body, including your specific wish list of areas. Typically the last place you store fat is the first area youll see a noticeable difference. Unfortunately, that also means the first place you started storing fat is usually the last area to get lean. Men  around the waist. Women  around the hips/butt.</p>
				<p>Until you reduce the body fat above or around your muscles  through cardiovascular exercise, resistance training, eating right, and adequate rest  youll never make those muscles or perfect set of abs visible.</p>

				<h3>The Third Wheel: Nutrition</h3>
				<p>Eating right isnt really all that complicated. Its a choice, and a conscious, daily choice at that. Making the right choice on a regular basis, and sticking with your choice over time, will get you there.</p>
				<h4>The Facts</h4>
				<p>Choose to eat the right way and you wont just improve every possible aspect of your health, but youll make the job of reshaping yourself through exercising that much easier. The time-starved amongst us are at the mercy of convenience eating, of what you eat and when. You are your own food-police deciding the type of foods you eat; I cant monitor that 24/7/365 because Im only with you for 1 hour at the gym. The other 23 hours are your responsibility.</p>
				<p>Inhale the wrong foods and you can easily prevent your system from operating at its most efficient level especially if youre active. Eat less than enough to counterbalance the extra nutritional requirements your body needs to maintain itself and youll store the same excess fat youre trying to get rid of because your body thinks its going to starve, and so it hold onto every calorie in anticipation of not getting any more.</p>
				<p>Regardless of what your goals are from exercise, following a few basic nutrition rules of the thumb will make this 3rd wheel worth a lot more to your body than you ever thought it could be.</p>
				<h4>Foundation</h4>
				<p>If youre trying to lose weight, calories may represent a guilty pleasure or a great evil to your brain. But to your body, calories are just energy units to be used as fuel.</p> 
				<p>You wouldnt give your car more fuel than it really needed, would you? If you did, all the fuel would just overflow and make a mess, right? Thats exactly what happens with your body. When you eat more calories than it needs, the result is overflow  to every place your body holds excess calories (a.k.a fat). It doesnt know you dont want to gain weight, it just sees all those extra calories and assumes you want to store them as energy-meaning fat-for later on.</p> 
				<p>Stand up and jump an inch or two off the ground. Anything move? For every pound of stored body fat you felt jiggle, all youre really looking at is roughly 3500 calories. Just 3500 units of fuel your body thinks it needs to hold onto because you havent given it any reason to think otherwise. But dont worry. Now that you know why youre storing calories, its going to be easier to convince your body to use them up and stop storing then unnecessarily.</p> 
				<p>Eating a low-fat, high-fibre diet along with doing aerobic exercise to burn calories and resistance training to maintain lean mass and to naturally boost your metabolism, is the most effective way to lose fat without holding you back from building muscle tissue. Try not to use the word diet because it makes people feel like theyre walking a tightrope-one tiny misstep (see doughnut!) and they assume that all their hopes and dreams will come crashing down. Diets are usually temporary by nature, leading to eventual failure, whereas an on-going healthy nutritional intake that is a lifestyle will last a lifetime.</p> 
				<h4>Calories</h4>
				<p>How many calories you really need to eat every day depends on who you are. Some people can maintain their bodyweight on 1400 calories a day, whereas others have metabolisms like a hummingbird, eat suet at every meal and never put on an ounce of fat. It all depends on everything from your metabolism and level of activity to your age, heritage, gender, and what youre putting in your mouth, and when youre putting it in your mouth.</p> 
				<p>As a starting point the most common method used by dieticians and other health-care professionals is the Harris-Benedict formula.</p> 
				<p>Men: 66 + (6.3 x wt in lbs) + (12.9 x height in inches) - (6.8 x age in years)</p> 
				<p>Women: 655 + (4.3 x wt in lbs) + (4.7 x height in inches) - (4.7 x age in years)</p> 
				<p>The number you are left with is your estimated basal metabolic rate expenditure (or BMR), the minimum number of calories your body needs just to keep you going. Getting to work, typing up that report, racing around trying  to find a decent place to eat  these are all extra actions that increase your BMR by around 20%. For example a 35 year old woman who weighs 140lbs and stands 5 feet 6 inches would have a BMR of approx 1402 calories a day. Multiply this by 120% and all she really needs to eat every day is 1683 calories. If your goal is to trim down, its just a matter of eating less and/or burning extra calories through exercise to lose weight.</p> 
				<h4>Carbohydrates, Proteins, and fats</h4>
				<p>No matter how many calories you need each day, its important to make sure they dont all come from the same place. Carbohydrates, proteins, and fats are all broken down at different speeds in the body to create a continual flow of caloric energy.</p>
				<p>Most nutritionists recommend dividing up your daily Carbohydrates, proteins, and fats using a ratio of 5:3:2 (respectively). This translates into getting 50% of your daily calories from carbs, 30% from protein, and 20% from fat. Using the example above, the woman that requires 1683 calories to maintain her weight would have a nutritional profile as follows to maintain her weight:</p> 
				<ul>
					<li>Carbohydrate	841.5 cal. (50%)</li>
					<li>Protein			504.9 cal. (30%)</li>
					<li>Fat				336.6 cal. (20%)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>To make this number crunching easier to calculate for everyday living we can equate these numbers further into grams and workout how much to allow for each meal.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Carbohydrate	210g (4 cal/g)</li>
					<li>Protein			126g (4 cal/g)</li>
					<li>Fat				37g (9 cal/g)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Its healthier to eat all day long, breaking-up your caloric intake into smaller increments (5 to 6 meals) instead of the standard 3, you also help curb binges, and also keep blood sugar levels even throughout the day. Larger meals raise your blood sugar, which can trigger an increase in the release of insulin within the bloodstream. Remember, little and often. The easiest way to accomplish 5 or even 6 meals per day is to moderate the traditional 3 meals in size and snack in between. One snack mid-morning and one mid-afternoon.</p> 
				<p>For the example above based on 1683 calories, each of the 5 meals would average 336 calories, carbs 42 grams, protein 25 grams, fats 7 grams. It would be unrealistic to expect an exact equality between meals but use these figures as a guide.</p>
				<p>There is so much good information on nutrition, whats good, whats not, nutrition plans, when to eat, when to stop, Ill leave that for you to decide whats a wise choice and whats an unwise choice (cue another 30 minutes cycling!).</p>
				<p>These are my nutritional guidelines:</p>

				<h3>The Fourth Wheel: Rest and Recovery</h3>
				<p>It sounds like the easiest wheel of the five to drive on, but its actually the one that most frequently gets either too much or too little use. Give your body too much rest and itll look like it. Give it too little and you increase your odds of not only injuring yourself, but never seeing the body-shaping results youre shooting for.</p>
				<h4>The facts</h4>
				<p>Whether you hate or love exercise, your body interprets all that time youve spent pulling, pushing, and sweating on gym equipment as on thing: stress. Thats why the time you give your muscles to rest and recover in between each workout can make a huge difference in the kind of results you end up seeing for all of your hard work.</p> 
				<p>Rest is also important between sets at the gym, 30 to 180 seconds ideally, depending on the intensity of the exercise and the routine. This downtime gives your body time to drain the muscles of any leftover lactic acid (a by-product of exercise that gives that fun, burning sensation towards the end of a set!).</p> 
				<p>Resting between workouts or lack of it is one of the biggest mistakes most overzealous exercisers make. Lifting weight causes microscopic breaks or tears inside your muscle fibres, breaks that trick your body into thinking its about go to war. These fibres react by rebuilding their legions to be stronger and firmer for the next battle, that is, if you give them an armistice to start recruiting. After exhausting a muscle with resistance training, it needs at least 48-72 hours of recovery time in order to heal from all that microscopic damage. If you work out before that time you risk injury, you wont be able to lift as much weight which will hold you back from using enough resistance to make your muscles stronger. Muscle strength is directly relative to muscle size. Increase your strength and the muscles have to respond by increasing in volume.</p> 
				<p>A decent nights sleep. Most healthy adults need an average of 7 to 9 hours of sleep a night. Whatever your cycle is, find it, stick with it.</p>

				<h3>The Steering Wheel: Mental Conditioning</h3>
				<p>What makes one person lie on a sofa eating pizza, chips and cake, while another may be up at 6am pounding the streets trying to beat a personal best? Why are some people more motivated than others? Not just at sport, exercise or at work, but in life?</p>
				<p>Each of us has motivations, goals and inspirational figures that shape what we do, what we think, how we react. Some of these goals are verbalised, debated and shared, some are deep rooted and personal. Some people talk a good job. Some people do it. It all starts in the mind.</p> 
				<p>Life is a mind game. All your aspirations are played out in your head. All your relationships are shaped in your head. Your mind dictates whether you fulfil your potential or live your life dreaming.  Its about attitude. The good thing in life is that you can choose your attitude, you cant always choose or change the circumstances in your arena, but you can always choose or change your attitude.</p> 
				<p>Sport and exercise provide a framework for personal development. It appeals to people because it meets a basic, instinctive need to want to take on challenges and succeed, and encourages people to develop skills along the way.</p> 
				<p>Its inappropriate to talk about a healthy lifestyle, fitness regime or weight training program as a sacrifice. What top performers do is make choices. We all have choices to make, its all about attitude.</p> 
				<p>If you want to lose weight or gain some definition in your arms you can visualize how you want to look after youve succeeded. So many people on diets (temporary punishment!) dont actually see themselves how they want to be, getting into certain clothes. If you visualize the result in advance itll help on days when you lose your motivation. But what is visualization? Its the process of seeing yourself doing what it is you need to do  whether running a winning race, throwing a record breaking javelin distance or lifting your heaviest weight. What the mind imagines usually creates a capacity for the body to do it.</p> 
				<p>What a person believes can determine the outcome. There is no doubt that in sport as in many other areas of life, there is such a thing as the self-fulfilling prophecy. If you limit your beliefs, you limit your potential to achieve.</p>
